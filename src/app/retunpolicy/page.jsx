          <li className="mb-2">The units have been photographed under lights and the actual product may differ slightly when seen under normal lights, though we maintain the originality in the photographs to utmost extent.</li>
          <li className="mb-4">Note- NO two crystals will be exactly alike in terms of their color, pattern, shape etc. This uniqueness adds to the charm and allure of crystals, as it highlights their individuality and distinctiveness. It's important to embrace their differences and appreciate the beauty of their natural variations. This understanding allows individuals to form personal connections with their crystals and to work with them in ways that resonate with their own energy and intentions.</li>
